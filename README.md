# What Drives the Price of a Car?

**A Data-Driven Analysis of Used Car Pricing Factors**

## Executive Summary

This project analyzes **107,681 used car listings** to identify the key factors that drive vehicle pricing in the used car market. Using Ridge Regression modeling, we achieved **±$4,832 prediction accuracy** and uncovered actionable insights for inventory management and pricing strategies.

## Key Findings

### Top 3 Price Drivers

1. **Title Status** - The single most important factor
   - Clean title is non-negotiable
   - "Parts only" title: **-144%** value destruction
   - Missing title: **-86%** value loss

2. **Vehicle Type** - Major price swings based on category
   - Pickups: **+36%** premium
   - Off-road vehicles: **+47%** premium
   - Wagons: **-62%** penalty

3. **Age & Mileage** - Strong depreciation indicators
   - Age correlation: **-0.575** (strong negative)
   - Odometer correlation: **-0.575** (strong negative)
   - Sweet spot: 5-10 years old, under 80K miles

## Business Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

**Priority 1: Title Status Screening**
- ✅ Implement mandatory clean title verification
- ✅ Never acquire vehicles with title issues
- ✅ Train acquisition team on "no exceptions" policy

**Priority 2: Focus on High-Demand Types**
- ✅ Stock more: Pickups, SUVs, off-road vehicles
- ✅ Stock less: Wagons, buses, sedans

**Priority 3: Target Optimal Age/Mileage**
- ✅ Focus on 2015-2020 models (5-10 years old)
- ✅ Prioritize vehicles under 80,000 miles
- ✅ Avoid vehicles with salvage/missing titles regardless of price

### Expected Business Impact

- **15-25%** margin improvement per vehicle
- **10-20%** increase in inventory turnover
- Reduced aged inventory (fewer vehicles sitting >90 days)
- Better customer satisfaction (stocking what buyers want)

### Models Tested

| Model | Train R² | Test R² | Test RMSE | Test MAE |
|-------|----------|---------|-----------|----------|
| Linear Regression | 0.3219 | 0.3243 | $7,456.76 | $4,834.89 |
| **Ridge Regression** | **0.3217** | **0.3244** | **$7,452.02** | **$4,832.43** |
| Lasso Regression | 0.3171 | 0.3212 | $7,485.40 | $4,867.43 |

**Winner:** Ridge Regression (α=10) - Best balance of performance and minimal overfitting

## Model Limitations

**What the model does well:**
- ✅ Identifies clear pricing patterns
- ✅ Provides reliable ballpark estimates (±$4,832)
- ✅ Strong generalization (no overfitting)
- ✅ Reveals hidden relationships through data cleaning

**What the model cannot do:**
- ❌ Perfect price prediction (explains 32% of variance, not 100%)
- ❌ Capture non-linear depreciation curves
- ❌ Account for individual vehicle history or seller motivation
- ❌ Include dropped features (model name, region)

**Use this model for:**
- Setting acquisition price ceilings
- Understanding market trends
- Making strategic inventory decisions
- Training acquisition staff

**Do NOT use for:**
- Exact pricing without market research
- Specialty/collector vehicles
- Overriding local market knowledge

## Methodology

### Data Preparation Strategy

**Aggressive Quality Focus:**
- Removed extreme outliers (prices >$100K, odometer >500K miles)
- Dropped rows with excessive missing values
- Retained only 25.2% of original data for reliability

**Why this approach?**
- Revealed true correlations (from near-zero to -0.575)
- Ensured model learns from clean, reliable data
- Prioritized quality over quantity

### Feature Engineering

- **One-hot encoding:** Categorical variables (manufacturer, type, fuel, etc.)
- **Ordinal encoding:** Condition (categorical with inherent order)
- **Created:** Age feature (2025 - year)
- **Dropped:** High-cardinality features (model, region) for practical reasons

## Key Insights for Dealerships

### The Golden Rule

> **Never acquire vehicles with title issues — no matter how attractive the price seems.**

Title status is the #1 driver of value. This single rule will prevent significant value destruction and protect your dealership from unsellable inventory.

### Inventory Acquisition Scorecard

**✅ IDEAL (Target These):**
- Clean title (non-negotiable)
- Pickups or off-road vehicles
- 5-10 years old
- Under 80,000 miles
- Premium brands (Porsche, Tesla, etc.)

**⚠️ ACCEPTABLE (Case by Case):**
- Clean title (still required)
- SUVs or trucks
- 10-15 years old
- 80K-120K miles
- Mainstream brands (Toyota, Honda, Ford)

**❌ REJECT (Avoid):**
- ANY title issues (parts only, missing, salvage)
- Wagons or buses
- 20 years old
- 150K miles
- Defunct brands (Mercury, Saturn, Fiat)
